I'm a Registered Dietitian and Digital Marketing Strategist who specialises in the health and wellness tech space.
I help brands scale their business by bridging the gap between clinical expertise and digital strategy. I leverage data-driven content and innovative technology, ensuring that genuine health knowledge reaches a wider audience, builds brand credibility, and drives measurable growth.

## Objective

My journey in nutrition science has led me to develop a passion for digital innovation using new technologies, and I am now eager to transform wellness practice into a scalable, high-value consulting business that serves the health and wellness tech industry.
